Steganography

This hides text in an Image . The text can be retrieved only if the original image is present . Computerphile has a video on this . This is my take on the video

This can be used to hide things in plain site , like things you don't want to see yourself or don't want others to see or to send secrets to others.

The change in the image cannot be noticed .
